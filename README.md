===================
# The NEW 2014 [dwightgnjohnson.com](http://dwightgnjohnson.com)! ...*maybe*
## Testing for me as well as clients

I love the idea having all of my code being hosted by Heroku and put through GitHub! I also like the idea of my clients moving away from Wordpress; I like Wordpress but it's so bulky and well boring. Let's See if this will be fun and more 2014 and beyond.
